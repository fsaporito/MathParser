Parser And Evaluator Of Mathematical Expression


=========

- Check correctness of mathematical expressions in infix (OK), prefix and postfix notation (WIP)
- Tokenise the mathematical expression (Done only for basic operations, no functions)
- Parse the mathematical expression (Done only for basic operations, no functions yet)
- Evaluates the mathematical expressions (Ok, correct even with functions - eventually with bigNum implementation)
  (In future with literal calculus)
- Basic GUI for calculator (only basic operations)


========
TO DO

- Add tokenisation of mathematical functions
- Add parsing of mathematical functions
- Add direct tokenisation of prefix and postfix notation
- Add direct parsing of prefix and postfix notation
- Improve GUI (evolve to scientific calculator)
- Add rational and complex number (Maybe revise whole number system in the application)
- Add misc functions:
  - average
  - fib
  - bynomial_factor
