Parser And Evaluator Of Mathematical Expression


=========

- Check correctness of mathematical expressions in infix (OK), prefix and postfix notation (WIP)
- Tokenise the mathematical expression (Done only for basic operations, and single argument functions)
- Parse the mathematical expression (Done only for basic operations and single argument functions)
- Evaluates the mathematical expressions (Ok, correct even with functions - eventually with bigNum implementation)
  (In future with literal calculus)
- Basic GUI for calculator (only basic operations and single argument functions)


========
TO DO

- Add definition of multiargument functions:
    -log_b (a, x) calculates log x in base a
    -sqrt_b (n, x) calculates general radicals, not only with 1/2 as exponent
- Add trigonometric and  hyperbolic functions not implememted in Java.Math (series expansion or external library)
- Add tokenisation of mathematical functions with more than one argument
- Add parsing of mathematical functions with more than one argument
- Add direct tokenisation of prefix and postfix notation
- Add direct parsing of prefix and postfix notation
- Improve GUI
- Add rational and complex number (Maybe revise whole number system in the application)
- Add misc functions:
  - average
  - fib (iterative method, with arrayList as dataStructure)
  - bynomial_factor (try different implementation)
